<p><strong>The Data Center Immersion Cooling Fluid Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-phase Immersion Cooling</li><li>Two-phase Immersion Cooling</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Data Center Immersion Cooling Fluid Market encompasses two primary applications: single-phase and two-phase immersion cooling. Single-phase immersion cooling involves submerging servers in a non-conductive fluid that efficiently dissipates heat, maintaining optimal operating temperatures. In contrast, two-phase immersion cooling leverages the phase change of the fluid—evaporating and condensing—to enhance heat transfer efficiency. Both methods significantly improve energy efficiency and thermal management in data centers, enabling higher density deployments and reducing cooling costs while enhancing overall system performance.</p></p>
